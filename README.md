# The-Gaming-Room

#Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room had created a game called Draw It or Lose It. Their goal was to enable cross platform capabilities with the game so that players on all platforms could enjoy the game together without limitations. 
The software requirements included:
- Capability of having one or more teams
- Each team should have multiple players
- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether the name is in use
- Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at one time

#What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I feel I did well in researching the capabilities of each OS to host a server and other server hosting options available for a game of this capacity.

#What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
In writing up the document you're able to narrow down exactly what needs to be accomplished in the code and how to best approach that. This then takes a lot of potential guess work out of code development.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
Most likely the section containing information about the different operating platforms. There was a lot of omitted information just for the sake of keeping the document a bit more tidy.
If I could have I would ahve written a separate document listing the pros and cons of each platform along with their costs and ease of use factors.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user would need a very clean and easy to interact with interface to allow for easy name setup, team pairing, server selection etc. The importance behind considering the user's needs
is the whole project. If you create something that a user doesn't enjoy using then the project is less likely to be successful. This can also lead to a bad taste in the mouths of users
in future projects that a company may produce.

#How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
The best method I ave found for myself so far is diagrams. Visual representation helps me quite a bit. I also find it easy to write more code if I can see other code that has been written
for similar circumstances and then alter it for my needs from there. In the future I would probably ask a lot of questions, especially starting out, I like working independantly but I 
also know when I need help and when it would be more beneficial to work with collaborators.
